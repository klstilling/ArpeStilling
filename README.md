# 02806 Social Data Analysis -- Assignment 2

We have put the programs that we wrote for extracting and formatting data in
the `data-extraction/` directory. These are in the IPython notebook format.
Since the dataset that we extract from is very large, we have decided not to
upload this to GitHub. You will have to supply this file yourself.

The `data/` directory contains the extracted datasets.

The D3 scripts that we made are found in the `js/` directory.

`css/`, `d3/` and `vendor/` contains various files used for styling etc. of the
website.
