The js scripts using D3 for visualizing crime data are found in the `js/` directory.

The Ipython notebook for part 2 of week05 exercises are found in the `week05-part2/` directory. Since the dataset that we extract from is very large, we have decided not to upload this to GitHub. You will have to supply this file yourself.

We have also included Ipython notebooks which we wrote for extracting and formatting data in
the `data-extraction/` directory. 

The `data/` directory contains the extracted datasets used for the D3 visualizations.

`css/`, `d3/` and `vendor/` contains various files used for styling etc. of the
website.
